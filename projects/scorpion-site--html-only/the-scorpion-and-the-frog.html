<h1>The Scorpion and the Frog</h1>

<p>On the bank of a wide and swift river, a scorpion sat wishing to be on the other side.
Since the scorpion couldn't swim, and there was no bridge in sight, he couldn't imagine how he might realize his wish.
Considering the problem, he noticed a frog sitting in some nearby rushes.</p>

<p>"Hello, Frog", said the scorpion,</p>
<p>"I would very much like to cross this river, but alas, I cannot swim. Might I ask you to ferry me across on your back?"</p>

<p>The frog considered the situation, then said, "I know who you are, Scorpion.
You have a nasty reputation. And a sharp sting in your tail.
How can I believe you would not sting me?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the scorpion, "Because I cannot swim, and so, if I sting you, I shall surely drown in the river."</p>

<p>Although Not completely conviced of the wisdom of helping sach a dangerous individual, the frog nevertheless did agree to take the scorpion on his back.
The scorpion climbed on, and the frog set off swimming, taking care not to topple his dangerous passenger into the water.</p>

<p>Once in the water the frog relaxed and started to feel more confident with his decision to help someone in need.
Halway across, the frog felt a sharp sting in his back.
He looked over his sholder in time to see the scorpion take his stinger out of his back.</p>

<p>"Why? You fool, you have killed us both"</p>

<p>The scorpion shrugged. "I could not help myself," he said.</p>

<p><strong>"It is my nature"</strong></p>
